check_access_log

Property of pburkholder.

Original release:
http://blog.pburkholder.com/2010/10/24/graphing-access-log-status-with-pnp4nagios/

This is a nagios plugin that reads the apache httpd access logs and creates a breakdown based on response codes.
It also provides the average troughput, in bytes per check_period.

The plugins comes with a template for pnp4nagios; I've tested it up to the 0.6.17, and it is working.

Requirements:
- File::ReadBackwards, that allows the script to read backwards until the time period criterion is met
- Date::Manip
- Nagios::Plugin

Usage: check_log3.pl [ -v|--verbose ] -l|--logfile=file -m|--m=minutes [ -c|--critical=<threshold>(20) ] [ -w|--warning=<threshold>(10) ] [ -a|--activity=number_of_lines (100) ] [ -e|--exclude=<subpath> ]

Where: 

- logfile is the path to your httpd access log;
- minutes is how far back from the present you want to parse your log files (defaults to 5 minutes);
- c represents the percentage of non-200 statuses that switch the outcome to critical
- w represents the percentage of non-200 statuses that switch the outcome to warning
- activity tells the plugin to evaluate the two percentages only if the number of lines parsed exceeds this number
- exclude is a subpath of the original request for which 401 should be treated as 200 (for example, svn behind basic authentication).
